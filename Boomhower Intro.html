<h3>Allow Me to Reintroduce Myself</h3>

<body>
  <div>
    <p>My name is Thomas Boomhower. I like history, sharks, Arnold Palmer, Alexander the Great, and America. In my free time I read about these things, write about them on my blog, or talk about them on my podcast.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="plug">
  <p> My blog is called <a href="https://thereferencesection.net/"><i><b>The Reference Section</b></i><a/> and my podcast is called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/highkey_obsessed_podcast/"><i><b>Highkey Obsessed</b></i><a/>.</p>
  </div>


<h1><i> Highkey Obsessed is available everywhere you get podcasts, and is supported by listeners like you. </i> </h1>

  <p>Now, I know what you're thinking, "is my guy really using a HW assignment to plug his podcast?"</p>
</div>

<h4>Well...</h4>
